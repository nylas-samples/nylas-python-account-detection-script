# Nylas Accounts Extractor

This Python script, developed by `wallacecs007`, interfaces with the Nylas API to extract account information, specifically targeting Microsoft accounts with password authentication, excluding personal account domains like Outlook, Hotmail, and MSN. The extracted data is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis or use.

- **Microsoft Account Filtering**: Filters out Microsoft accounts with 'password' authentication type.
- **Domain Exclusion**: Excludes personal Microsoft account domains.
